#Week1 was intense. I personally enjoy the challenge. I fell behind on day 1 and day 
#2 which has lead to further learning complications. I enjoy the structur of
#the curriculum because allows me to understand where my hangups are occuring
#though s bit stressful. Today improved my comnfidence in my ability to learn.
