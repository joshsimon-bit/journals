# Week 2 has been exciting, yet challenging. This week we will be assigned our first group project, which will require us to demonstrate our Python skills.
# I'm a bit intimidated by the project as my team is setting a high goal for our team. I am interested to see how it will all come together. I know the course will
# soon introduce a new language to us. I am hoping to gain more confidence in other languages, but python has not been something I feel I can't become more profecient 
# in.
